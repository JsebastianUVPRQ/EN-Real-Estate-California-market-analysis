# EN-Real-Estate-California-market-analysis

Welcome,  California Housing Prices Prediction project, an end-to-end machine learning endeavor. In this project, I have selected the California Housing Prices dataset 
from the StatLib repository, which is based on data from the 1990 California census. Despite its age, this dataset offers valuable insights and serves as an excellent 
resource for learning. Additionally, we have introduced a categorical attribute and made some feature adjustments to tailor it to our specific goals.

- Project Overview
The project follows a systematic approach with the following key steps:

- Look at the Big Picture:
Understand the project's objectives, requirements, and the California Housing Prices dataset.

- Get the Data:
Acquire the dataset from the StatLib repository, ensuring that we have a comprehensive understanding of its structure and attributes.

- Discover and Visualize the Data:
Explore the dataset to gain insights into the patterns, distributions, and relationships among different features. Visualization tools will be employed to facilitate a better understanding.

- Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms:
Cleanse and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers. Feature engineering may be employed to enhance the model's performance.

- Select a Model and Train It:
Choose an appropriate machine learning model for predicting California housing prices. Train the selected model using the prepared dataset.

- Fine-tune the Model:
Optimize the model's performance through fine-tuning, adjusting hyperparameters, and employing cross-validation techniques.

- Present the Solution:
Communicate the findings, insights, and the developed model's performance. Visualizations and concise summaries will be provided.

- Launch, Monitor, and Maintain the System:
Implement the model into a functional system, monitor its performance, and establish a maintenance plan for sustained accuracy and relevance.
